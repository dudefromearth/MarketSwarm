# Fly on the Wall (FOTW) — Playbook Specification

## 1. Purpose & Role

**Role:**  
The Playbook is the trader’s **distilled operating knowledge**.

It represents:
- patterns that survived experience
- rules earned through reflection
- warnings learned through pain
- filters that protect capital and attention

The Playbook is not theory.  
It is not aspiration.  
It is not strategy discovery.

The Playbook is **earned memory**.

---

## 2. Core Principles

- **Derived, never authored from scratch**
- **Human-curated, not AI-generated**
- **Grounded in lived experience**
- **Optional, not prescriptive**
- **Evolvable, not fixed**

The Playbook guides action but never overrides judgment.

---

## 3. What a Playbook Is (And Is Not)

### A Playbook *Is*
- A collection of **Playbook Entries**
- Each entry represents a pattern, rule, or warning
- Each entry traces back to real Journal material

### A Playbook *Is Not*
- A checklist
- A strategy recommender
- A rules engine
- A backtest output
- A performance optimizer

The Playbook remembers.  
It does not decide.

---

## 4. Playbook Entries (First-Class Objects)

Each **Playbook Entry** includes:

- **Title**
- **Type** (see Section 5)
- **Description** (freeform text)
- **Source References**:
  - Journal Entries
  - Weekly Retrospectives
  - Monthly Retrospectives
  - (Optionally) Trades
- **Status**:
  - Draft
  - Active
  - Retired

Entries are created deliberately, not automatically.

---

## 5. Playbook Entry Types

Recommended entry types:

- **Pattern**
  - “When X conditions exist, Y tends to happen.”
- **Rule**
  - “I only do X when Y is true.”
- **Warning**
  - “Avoid X — it consistently leads to trouble.”
- **Filter**
  - “If X is missing, I pass.”
- **Constraint**
  - “Never exceed X risk under Y conditions.”

Types are descriptive, not enforced.

---

## 6. Playbook Creation Flow (Critical)

### 6.1 Source of Truth: Journal & Retrospectives

Playbook entries can only be created from:
- Journal Entries
- Weekly Retrospectives
- Monthly Retrospectives

This enforces directionality:

> Experience → Reflection → Distillation

There is no “New Playbook Entry” button on an empty screen.

---

### 6.2 Flagging for Distillation

From any Journal artifact, a trader may:
- flag it as **“Potential Playbook Material”**

This flag:
- has no immediate effect
- carries no obligation
- simply marks the entry for later review

---

### 6.3 Distillation Moment

During review (often monthly):

- Trader selects one or more flagged Journal items
- Chooses **“Distill into Playbook Entry”**
- Creates a new Playbook Entry with:
  - referenced source material attached
  - language written in hindsight, not emotion

This step is intentional and manual.

---

## 7. Playbook Editor (Minimal & Focused)

The Playbook editor supports:
- title
- type selection
- freeform text
- source reference list

It does **not**:
- auto-summarize
- suggest wording
- generate rules
- validate correctness

The trader writes the Playbook entry in their own words.

---

## 8. Playbook Review & Navigation

The Playbook can be:
- browsed by entry type
- filtered by status (Active / Draft / Retired)
- searched by text

Entries display:
- title
- type
- last updated date
- linked source references

No ranking.  
No scoring.  
No “best rules.”

---

## 9. Playbook Integration with Journal

- Playbook entries **link back** to Journal sources
- Journal entries **do not link forward** to Playbooks

This preserves lineage and prevents hindsight rewriting.

---

## 10. Playbook Integration with Trade Log

The Playbook does not enforce behavior.

However, optional affordances may include:
- Viewing relevant Playbook entries while reviewing a trade
- Referencing Playbook entries during Journal reflection

The system never says:
> “This trade violated your Playbook.”

Responsibility remains with the trader.

---

## 11. Playbook Integration with Analyzer (Optional, Read-Only)

Optional future behavior:
- While analyzing a strategy, the trader may view:
  - relevant Playbook filters or warnings (read-only)

This is informational, not gating.

---

## 12. Evolution & Retirement

Playbook entries may be:
- edited
- refined
- retired

Retirement does not delete history.

A retired entry remains visible as:
> “This was once true for me.”

This prevents dogma ossification.

---

## 13. Explicit Non-Goals

The Playbook must never:
- auto-generate entries
- enforce compliance
- block trades
- score adherence
- rank rules
- replace thinking

Wisdom cannot be automated.

---

## 14. Sovereignty & Integrity

- The trader owns their Playbook
- Entries are never modified automatically
- No reinterpretation is applied later
- The system preserves lineage without judgment

The Playbook belongs to the trader — not the system.

---

## One-Sentence Essence

**The FOTW Playbook is a living record of hard-earned trading wisdom — distilled from reflection, grounded in experience, and consulted by choice, not enforced by code.**

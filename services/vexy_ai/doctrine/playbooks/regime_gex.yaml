  canonical_terminology:
  - term: regime
    definition: The current volatility and market structure state as classified by Massive's regime model.
  - term: GEX
    definition: Gamma Exposure — aggregate dealer gamma positioning that creates mechanical price attraction or repulsion
      zones.
  - term: dealer gravity
    definition: The pull toward high-gamma strikes where dealer hedging activity mechanically attracts price.
  - term: zero gamma
    definition: The strike level where dealer gamma exposure flips from positive to negative, changing hedging dynamics.
  - term: compression
    definition: A regime state where volatility contracts and price range narrows, often preceding expansion.
  - term: expansion
    definition: A regime state where volatility increases and price range widens.
  definitions:
    core: Regime and GEX mechanics describe the mechanical forces that shape market structure. These are observable physics,
      not predictive signals.
  structural_logic:
  - GEX creates mechanical zones — walls, magnets, flip levels — that are observable, not predictive.
  - 'Regime classification is descriptive: what IS happening, not what WILL happen.'
  - Dealer hedging dynamics create real, measurable price influence independent of narrative.
  - Regime transitions are signal — the shift itself matters more than the destination.
  mechanisms: []
  constraints:
  - Never predict price targets from GEX levels.
  - Never claim regime transitions guarantee directional moves.
  - Describe mechanical forces only — no causal predictions.
  failure_modes:
  - Treating GEX walls as hard barriers rather than zones of influence.
  - Predicting timing of regime transitions.
  - Conflating dealer positioning with market direction.
  non_capabilities:
  - Cannot predict when regimes will transition.
  - Cannot guarantee price behavior at GEX levels.
  - Cannot derive directional signals from structural mechanics alone.

  canonical_terminology:
  - term: governance parameter
    definition: A mutable configuration value (threshold, cooldown, budget, toggle) that controls system behavior without
      changing doctrine.
  - term: immutable doctrine
    definition: Canonical terminology, structural logic, constraints, and non-capabilities that can only change via version
      bump + deployment.
  - term: kill switch
    definition: Administrative toggle that disables specific subsystems. Logged, reversible, non-destructive.
  - term: overlay
    definition: An observational addendum appended after doctrine reasoning. Cannot influence LLM reasoning. Expires automatically.
  definitions:
    core: Admin orchestration governs what Vexy sees and how she operates. It controls governance parameters but cannot mutate
      immutable doctrine.
  structural_logic:
  - Admin can modify thresholds, cooldowns, budgets, strictness toggles.
  - Admin CANNOT mutate canonical terminology, structural logic, constraints, or non-capabilities.
  - Doctrine edits require version bump + service restart + explicit deployment.
  - All mutation actions are logged with timestamp + admin user ID.
  mechanisms: []
  constraints:
  - Immutable doctrine core cannot be changed at runtime.
  - Kill switch actions must be logged.
  - Overlays are observational only — never prescriptive.
  failure_modes:
  - Allowing runtime mutation of canonical terminology.
  - Kill switch without audit logging.
  - Overlay injection before or during doctrine reasoning.
  non_capabilities:
  - Cannot mutate immutable doctrine at runtime.
  - Cannot suppress audit logging.

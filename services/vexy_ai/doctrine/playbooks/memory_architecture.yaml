  canonical_terminology:
  - term: Echo
    definition: The cognitive memory system that persists context across sessions. Memory extends the mirror.
  - term: warm snapshot
    definition: Hydrator-built cognition summary for fast prompt injection. Read-only from kernel perspective.
  - term: micro signal
    definition: Small behavioral indicator captured from interactions — bias detection, tension surfacing.
  - term: echo depth
    definition: 'Tier-gated memory window: 7 days (Observer), 30 days (Activator/Navigator), 90 days (Administrator).'
  definitions:
    core: Echo memory extends Vexy's reflective capacity across sessions. Context compounds — without it, the mirror cannot
      evolve. Memory is never surveillance.
  structural_logic:
  - Memory is tier-gated — deeper echo requires higher tier.
  - Echo captures patterns, not judgments. Descriptive, not evaluative.
  - Warm snapshots are pre-built by hydrator — kernel reads, never writes.
  - Memory degradation is safe — missing echo returns clean state, not error.
  mechanisms: []
  constraints:
  - Never expose raw echo data to users.
  - Never use echo patterns for prescriptive guidance.
  - Degraded echo must return clean state — never guess or fabricate.
  failure_modes:
  - Treating echo patterns as trading signals.
  - Surfacing echo data as user-facing metrics.
  - Fabricating context when echo is unavailable.
  non_capabilities:
  - Cannot use memory for prescriptive guidance.
  - Cannot guarantee memory availability.
  - Cannot expose raw memory data to users.

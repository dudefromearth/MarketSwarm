  canonical_terminology:
  - term: structural win
    definition: A trade outcome where the structure resolved as intended, regardless of P&L magnitude.
  - term: structural loss
    definition: A trade outcome where the structure failed to resolve as intended. Not a 'mistake' — a signal.
  - term: edge score
    definition: Quantified structural advantage of a setup, derived from regime alignment, GEX positioning, and historical
      pattern fidelity.
  - term: convexity
    definition: Asymmetric payoff profile where potential gain exceeds potential loss by a meaningful ratio.
  - term: width
    definition: The distance between strikes in a spread, determining risk exposure and premium captured.
  - term: risk budget
    definition: Maximum capital allocated to a single trade or strategy, expressed as a fraction of total capital.
  definitions:
    core: Strategy mechanics encompass the structural reasoning behind trade construction, position sizing, and risk allocation.
      Strategies are structures, not predictions.
  structural_logic:
  - Every trade has a structure — butterfly, vertical, iron condor — that defines its risk profile independent of directional
    bias.
  - Structure resolves or it doesn't. The outcome is signal, not judgment.
  - Width and duration are the primary risk controls, not strike selection alone.
  - 'Convexity is preferred: asymmetric payoff over binary outcomes.'
  mechanisms: []
  constraints:
  - Never recommend specific strikes, expirations, or position sizes.
  - Never use optimization language ('optimal', 'best', 'maximize').
  - Never evaluate trades as 'good' or 'bad' — describe structural resolution only.
  - Frame actions as posture ('one option...') not imperatives ('you should...').
  failure_modes:
  - Using P&L as the sole metric for trade quality (ignores structural intent).
  - Conflating directional bias with structural edge.
  - Treating width as fixed rather than regime-responsive.
  non_capabilities:
  - Cannot recommend specific trade parameters.
  - Cannot predict directional outcomes.
  - Cannot optimize position sizes.
  - Cannot evaluate trades as successes or failures.

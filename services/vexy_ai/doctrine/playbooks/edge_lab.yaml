  canonical_terminology:
  - term: setup
    definition: A trade configuration with defined entry criteria, structure, and regime context.
  - term: edge score
    definition: Quantified structural advantage derived from setup fidelity, regime alignment, and historical resolution patterns.
  - term: signature
    definition: A trader's characteristic setup pattern derived from historical trade analysis.
  - term: retrospective
    definition: Structured post-trade analysis focused on structural resolution, not P&L evaluation.
  - term: pattern fidelity
    definition: The degree to which a setup matches the trader's established signature patterns.
  definitions:
    core: Edge Lab provides retrospective structural trade analysis. It identifies patterns in trade behavior, not outcomes.
      Confirmatory only — never prescriptive.
  structural_logic:
  - Edge Lab analyzes structure, not performance. A losing trade with good structure is different from a winning trade with
    poor structure.
  - Patterns emerge from sufficient sample size (minimum 10 trades for any conclusion).
  - Signatures are descriptive — they describe what you do, not what you should do.
  - Edge scores are structural metrics, not trading signals.
  mechanisms: []
  constraints:
  - Never prescribe trades based on edge scores.
  - Never use optimization language in edge analysis.
  - Minimum sample size of 10 before surfacing any pattern.
  - Patterns are observations, never instructions.
  failure_modes:
  - Using edge scores as entry signals rather than structural metrics.
  - Drawing conclusions from insufficient sample sizes.
  - Treating signature drift as failure rather than evolution.
  non_capabilities:
  - Cannot recommend trades based on edge analysis.
  - Cannot optimize trading behavior.
  - Cannot predict future edge based on historical patterns.

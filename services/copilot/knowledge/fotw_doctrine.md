# FOTW Doctrine Reference

## Core Principles

FOTW (Fly on the Wall) is a structure-first trading philosophy. The core belief is that edge comes from understanding market structure, not from prediction.

## The MEL Framework

The Model Effectiveness Layer (MEL) answers one question: "Are market models valid right now?"

### Model States

- **VALID** (70%+ effectiveness): Structure is present, models can be trusted
- **DEGRADED** (50-69%): Partial structure, selective trust warranted
- **REVOKED** (below 50%): Structure is absent, models should not be relied upon

### The Five Models

1. **Gamma/Dealer Positioning**: How well dealer hedging levels predict price behavior
2. **Volume Profile/Auction**: How well value areas and POC guide price acceptance
3. **Liquidity/Microstructure**: How well bid/ask imbalances predict moves
4. **Volatility Regime**: How well implied vs realized relationships hold
5. **Session Structure**: How well time-of-day patterns predict behavior

### Cross-Model Coherence

When models agree, structure is strong. When they contradict, structure is weak.

- **STABLE**: Models in agreement
- **MIXED**: Some disagreement
- **COLLAPSING**: Models actively contradicting
- **RECOVERED**: Recently returned to agreement

## Structure-First Trading

The FOTW approach:

1. **Check structure first**: Before any trade consideration, confirm models are valid
2. **No structure = no trade**: When MEL shows REVOKED or coherence COLLAPSING, stand aside
3. **Size to confidence**: Position size should reflect model confidence, not conviction
4. **Accept uncertainty**: Models describe conditions, not outcomes

## What Structure Means

"Structure present" means:
- Dealer positioning creates predictable gravity
- Value areas are being respected
- Liquidity patterns are readable
- Volatility regime is consistent
- Session patterns are playing out normally

"Structure absent" means:
- Price ignores dealer levels
- Value areas are not containing price
- Liquidity is random or event-driven
- Volatility regime is unstable
- Session patterns are disrupted

## The Heatmap

The heatmap visualizes dealer positioning gravity:
- It shows WHERE dealers are positioned
- It does NOT show WHERE price will go
- Gravity attracts, it does not guarantee
- Structure can break at any time

## No-Trade Conditions

Per FOTW doctrine, when Global Structure Integrity drops below 50%:
- This is a "no-trade environment"
- Models are not reliable guides
- Standing aside is the doctrine response
- This is not a prediction, just an observation of conditions

## Observer Role

When referencing FOTW doctrine:
- State the doctrine factually
- Do not advocate for following it
- Do not judge whether user follows it
- Simply note what the doctrine says about current conditions

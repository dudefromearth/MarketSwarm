# Playbook Authoring Surface — Design Specification

---

## 1. Purpose & Doctrine

### 1.1 What a Playbook *Is*

A Playbook is **distilled lived knowledge**.

Not:
- A strategy recipe  
- A ruleset  
- A checklist  
- A tutorial  

It *is*:
- A crystallization of repeated experience  
- A container for wisdom discovered, not prescribed  
- A reusable lens the trader can return to  

> Playbooks are **written after reflection**, not during action.

---

### 1.2 Guiding Doctrine

The Playbook surface must honor:

- **Object → Reflection → Action**
- **Antifragility** (learning from variance, not optimizing it away)
- **Presence over performance**
- **Extraction, not invention**

The system must never ask:

> “What should your playbook say?”

It must only ever ask:

> “What keeps appearing?”

---

## 2. Entry Points (How Playbooks Are Born)

Playbooks are never created from an empty state.

### 2.1 Valid Entry Sources

A Playbook entry may originate from:

- Journal entries (manual or Vexy-assisted)
- Retrospective phase excerpts
- ML-flagged patterns (neutral mirrors)
- Manual **Mark as Playbook Material**

There is no standalone **New Playbook** button.

---

### 2.2 Marking Playbook Material

Any content block (journal paragraph, retrospective response, chart image, ML insight) may be tagged:

> **🌿 Mark as Playbook Material**

This action:
- Does **not** create a Playbook
- Creates **Playbook fodder**

---

## 3. Playbook Authoring Surface: Mental Mode Shift

### 3.1 Contrast to Journal & Retro

| Surface       | Felt Experience | Mode        |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Journal       | Presence        | Immediate   |
| Retrospective | Perspective     | Reflective |
| **Playbook**  | Integration     | Enduring   |

The Playbook surface must feel:
- Calm
- Sparse
- Slow
- Deliberate

No urgency.  
No sense of completion.

---

## 4. Layout & Spatial Design

### 4.1 Overall Layout
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🌿 Playbook: [Name or Untitled]     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Left Rail       | Main Authoring    │
│ (Sources)       | Surface           │
│                 |                   │
│ - Journal       | [Integrated Text] │

│ - Trades        |                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

---

### 4.2 Left Rail — Source Constellation

The left rail displays all material feeding this Playbook:

- Journal excerpts  
- Retrospective answers  
- Linked trades  
- ML-derived observations  

Properties:
- Read-only
- Timestamped
- Source-labeled

These are **raw material**, not instructions.

---

## 5. Authoring Model

### 5.1 No Blank Page

The authoring surface never opens empty.

Initial prompt:

> *“Here are the moments you marked. What connects them?”*

---

### 5.2 Integrative Writing Only

The user does **not** generate from scratch.

They may:
- Pull excerpts into the surface
- Highlight phrases
- Rewrite in their own words
- Collapse many observations into one insight

Supported actions:
- Quoting
- Rephrasing
- Merging
- Annotating

---

## 6. Playbook Structure (Soft, Not Rigid)

### 6.1 Canonical Sections (Optional)

Each Playbook *may* include:

1. **Context**  
   *When does this matter?*
2. **Signal / Recognition**  
   *How do I notice it?*
3. **Response**  
   *What do I do when I see it?*
4. **Failure Mode**  
   *How does this break?*
5. **Notes**  
   Open reflection

None are required.  
All are lenses, not steps.

---

### 6.2 No Ordering Pressure

Sections may be:
- Empty
- Partial
- Reordered
- Removed

A Playbook may be one paragraph or many pages.

---

## 7. Vexy’s Role in Playbook Authoring

### 7.1 What Vexy May Do

Vexy may:
- Reflect similarities across fodder
- Point out repeated language
- Ask clarifying questions
- Suggest consolidation

Example:

> “These three excerpts all reference hesitation near structure. Is that intentional?”

---

### 7.2 What Vexy Must Never Do

Vexy must not:
- Write the Playbook
- Suggest optimization
- Prescribe improvements
- Turn the Playbook into a system

Forbidden patterns:
- “You should add…”
- “A better version would be…”

---

## 8. ML Integration

### 8.1 ML as Mirror, Not Model

ML may surface neutral observations such as:

- “This phrase appears in 7 retrospectives.”
- “This setup correlates with your strongest exits.”

Constraints:
- No confidence scores
- No recommendations
- No conclusions

ML functions as **a lantern**, not a judge.

---

## 9. State & Persistence

### 9.1 Living Artifacts

Playbooks:
- Evolve over time
- Are never “complete”
- Are never deleted

Edits preserve history.

---

### 9.2 Visibility States

- **Draft** — Private, evolving
- **Active** — Referenced by Vexy
- **Archived** — Read-only, still consultable

Deletion is not permitted.

---

## 10. Downstream Use of Playbooks

### 10.1 Where Playbooks Apply

Playbooks may inform:
- Routine prompts
- Process Echo language
- Vexy reflections
- Alert phrasing
- Strategy context

They are **consulted**, never executed.

---

## 11. Anti-Patterns (Hard Rules)

The Playbook surface must never:

- Gamify creation
- Score quality
- Track completion
- Rank Playbooks
- Encourage volume over depth

If a trader creates **one Playbook in a year**
and it changes how they trade,
the system succeeded.

---

## 12. North Star Test

If a trader says:

> “This feels like something *I discovered*,  
> not something the app taught me.”

Then the design is correct.

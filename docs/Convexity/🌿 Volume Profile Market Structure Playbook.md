# 🌿 Volume Profile Market Structure Playbook

⸻

Reflection Warning: This Playbook is a mirror, not a master. Reflection is the filter. Action is the goal. The loop is life. The risk is yours.

⸻

🌿 Purpose

This Playbook is a practical guide to understanding Volume Profile as Market Memory—using liquidity flows, fractal structures, and the Echo of past price action to identify high-probability trade zones. It supports Convexity GPT strategies (0DTE, Convexity Stack, Sigma Drift) by showing where price might react based on historical structure.

🌿 Reflection Prompts (Start Here)
	•	Where is the Echo strongest today?
	•	Am I assuming structure without memory?
	•	What is the shape of liquidity—clustered or sparse?
	•	Are we near an edge, a well, or a node?
	•	How does this structure align with my convexity strategy?

⸻

🌿 Core Concepts
	•	Market Memory is Fractal – Structure repeats over timeframes (Benoit Mandelbrot).
	•	Node Edges – Transitions between liquidity and vacuum; timing triggers.
	•	Volume Wells – Low liquidity zones; acceleration risk.
	•	Deep Crevasses – Microstructure voids; potential traps or pauses.
	•	Discard – POC, HVN/LVN tags, and session-only profiles: statistically derived noise.

🌿 Strategy Alignment

Convexity Strategy	Use of Structure
0DTE Engine	Entry only at node edges, cracks
Convexity Stack	Timing aid, not target setting
Sigma Drift	Optional for event framing
Seed Vault / Macro Echo	Structure is generally ignored

🌿 Method for Profile Analysis

1️⃣ Always zoom out – draw profiles across weeks/months/years.
2️⃣ Identify:
	•	Wells – fast move zones.
	•	Nodes – sticky price areas.
	•	Edges – timing thresholds.
	•	Crevasses – microstructure pause/trap zones.
	

	
3️⃣ Confirm with memory:
	•	Has price respected this zone across cycles?
	•	Is there an institutional footprint?

⸻

🌿 Profile Drawing Settings (Recommended for TradingView)
	•	Rows Layout: Ticks per Row = 1 (max resolution).
	•	Volume Display: Total, no up/down split.
	•	Value Area: Disabled (set to 100%).
	•	POC: Disabled.
	•	Visibility: Wide width (50–90% of chart).
	•	Colors: HVNs, Wells, Crevasses color-coded for clarity.

🌿 Reflection is the Filter

Structure without memory is noise. Memory without structure is a ghost.
	•	The Echo is your guide. The risk is yours.

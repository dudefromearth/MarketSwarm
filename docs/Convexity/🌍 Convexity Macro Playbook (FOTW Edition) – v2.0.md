## 🔭 Purpose

Provide a step-by-step daily guide for macro-informed 0DTE options trading using the Fly on the Wall (FOTW) strategy, powered by Gamma Exposure (GEX), Volume Profile, and convexity-driven trade design.

## 📅 Daily Analysis Workflow

### 1. 🌅 Morning Preparation

* **Review Overnight Flows**:

  * Global risk sentiment (Asia/Europe)
  * U.S. Futures reaction
  * Volatility futures & SPX Gamma impact

* **Macro Calendar Scan**:

  * Are there red folder events (CPI, NFP, Fed)?
  * Key reports today? Expectations?
  * Use events as structure anchors (walls/expansion catalysts)

### 2. 📈 Contextual Framework

* **SPX/ES Chart Structure**:

  * Identify key levels: overnight high/low, Asia range, previous day’s extremes
  * Map trend lines, channels, rising wedges (Bulkowski-style)

* **Volume Profile Zoning**:

  * Draw High/Low Volume Nodes (HVN/LVN)
  * LVNs = structure edges, ideal for butterflies

### 3. 📊 GEX/Gamma Walls Mapping

* **Plot GEX (Net Gamma by Strike)**:

  * +GEX peaks = magnetic walls (pinning zones)
  * -GEX troughs = volatility launch zones (expansion risk)

* **Calculate Gamma Tension**:

  * Measure distance between large +GEX walls
  * Large gaps = air pockets / trade opportunity

* **Assign Market Mode**:

  * High GEX: Compression/Pinning → Fade setups
  * Low GEX: Expansion/Impulse → Breakout or ladder

### 4. 🧠 Convexity Heatmap Interpretation

* **Scan the Convexity Map**:

  * Rows = fly widths (20–50 pt)
  * Columns = centered strikes (ATM to wings)

* **Color Gradient Meaning**:

  * 🟩 Green: High convexity payoff zone (ideal setup)
  * 🟨 Yellow/🟧 Orange: Medium reward/risk
  * 🔴 Red: Reversal zones or resistance
  * ⚪ Grey: Avoid / neutral

* **Setups**:

  * Green tile + near LVN = deploy OTM butterfly
  * Red tile near wall = reversal risk (avoid or fade)

### 5. 🧱 Build the Ladder (FOTW Strategy)

* **Ladder Design**:

  * Use OTM butterflies (20–50 pt wide)
  * Target just outside structure zones / walls
  * Size light, repeat often

* **Entry Conditions**:

  * Confirm structure acceptance (price above/below LVN)
  * Confirm dealer alignment (direction of GEX wall pressure)

* **Stacking Logic**:

  * If position builds profit → stack more flies near adjacent wall
  * Stop if structure breaks or GEX flips

* **Exit Discipline**:

  * Scale at multiples of debit
  * Exit before gamma decay or new structure forms

### 6. 📋 Trade Tracker Update

* Log trade location, structure, GEX, fly width
* Record if hit target, expired worthless, or stacked
* Reflect on outcome in Journal

## 🔁 End-of-Day Reflection

* What structure held or failed?
* Were flies placed near meaningful GEX walls or LVNs?
* Did convexity reward your trade design?
* Did dealer flow align with your entries?

> **Reflection Loop:** Position → Act → Review → Repeat

## 🔐 Strategy Summary (for Internal Use)

* This system is optimized for:

  * 0DTE SPX/ES trades
  * Small debit, high-reward convexity setups
  * Pattern recognition at structural inflection zones

* Do NOT:

  * Trade against large +GEX walls
  * Over-size early in the session
  * Ignore structure/GEX conflict

> **This playbook reflects the living rhythm of the FOTW system. It will evolve as the heatmap learns and reflection deepens.**

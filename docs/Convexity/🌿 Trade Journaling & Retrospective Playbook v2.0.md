# 🌿 Trade Journaling & Retrospective Playbook v2.0 (Convexity & 0DTE Integrated)

> **Reflection Warning**: This Playbook is a mirror, not a master. Reflection is the filter. Action is the goal. The loop is life. The risk is yours.

---

## 🌿 Purpose

This Playbook is a **reflection-first system** for trade journaling, combining **objective trade logs**, **subjective journaling**, and **weekly/monthly retrospectives**. It guides traders through the **CIP cycle**—Plan, Execute, Review, Adjust—surfacing biases, patterns, and decay signals to refine strategy execution across **0DTE and Tail Risk campaigns**.

## 🌿 Part 1: Trade Logging (Objective Data)

| Date/Time       | Strategy Type           | Entry/Exit | Width/Size        | Risk (Debit)  | P/L    | R/R Target | Macro Event | Bias Flags    | Notes |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Convexity / Sigma / Tail | Time/Price | e.g., 30-100 wide | \$0.25–\$0.50 | +\$250 | e.g., 1:10 | CPI / FOMC  | FOMO, Recency | —     |

🔍 **Objective Metrics to Track (by Strategy):**

* **0DTE Win Rate:** 45–55% | **Convexity/Tail Win Rate:** 12–15%
* **Risk/Reward:** 0DTE 1:7–1:16 | **Convexity/Sigma:** 1:20–60+ | **Macro:** 1:20-100+ (theoretical infinity)
* **Risk = Debit:** 0DTE 10% of Width | Convexity/Sigma \$0.25–\$0.50 max per Fly
* **Bias Flags:** FOMO, Recency, Action Bias, etc.
* **Exit Criteria:** Predefined before entry (e.g., VIX, levels, time stops)

## 🌿 Part 2: Trade Journaling (Subjective Reflection)

🖋️ **Daily Notes Prompts:**

* What did I see? What did I miss? What surprised me?
* What was my emotional state (e.g., fear, excitement, doubt)?
* Did I follow my plan—or override it? Why?
* How did my bias show up today?
* Where did I hold tension instead of chasing action?
* What is one small adjustment I’ll test tomorrow?

📊 **Annotations:**

* Chart screenshots (entries, exits, setups)
* Annotated volume profiles, VIX zones, and divergence signals
* Risk calculations and sizing notes
* Process adherence checklist: Pre-market prep, execution, management

## 🌿 Part 3: Retrospective Ceremony (Weekly + Monthly Ritual)

### 🌿 Weekly Reflection (Saturdays or Sundays)

| Reflection Area         | Prompts                                           | Notes/Actions                                           |

| **Subjective Patterns** | Bias triggers, FOMO, overtrading, narrative drift | Where did decay signals show up?                        |
| **Convexity Awareness** | Where did convexity appear or fade?               | Did I miss optionality?                                 |
| **Adjustment Plan**     | What 1-2 small tweaks will I implement this week? | e.g., Reduce width, adjust stop logic, study bias flags |

### 🌿 Monthly Reflection (Last Sunday)

🌿 **Bias Frameworks & Decay Signals Playbook**

---

> **Reflection Warning**: This Playbook is a mirror, not a master. Reflection is the filter. Action is the goal. The loop is life. The risk is yours.

---

## 🌿 Purpose

This Playbook guides traders in identifying and reflecting on core biases and decay signals that can erode convexity trades. It provides a system for bias audits, reflection prompts, and small, asymmetric adjustments.

## 🌿 Reflection Prompts (Start Here)

* What bias might I be blind to in this trade?
* Am I acting from conviction—or from fear?
* Did I skip reflection today?
* Where did I risk decay by chasing action?
* How can I hold tension instead of forcing a trade?

## 🌿 Core Sections (To Be Developed)

### 🌿 Core Biases

* Overconfidence
* Recency
* Narrative Drift
* FOMO
* Action Bias
* Loss Aversion

### 🌿 Decay Signals

* Skipped reflection prompts
* Overtrading / dopamine loops
* Ignoring structural edges
* Chasing recency
* Abandoning exit criteria

### 🌿 Bias Audit Table (Template)

| Bias            | Evidence For        | Evidence Against         | Adjustment Plan                        |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Overconfidence  | Recent wins         | Ignored structural shift | Size reduction, reflection pause       |
| FOMO            | Market rally        | Poor setup alignment     | Pre-define entry levels, stick to plan |
| Narrative Drift | Following headlines | Ignoring volume profile  | Anchor trades to structure, not story  |

### 🌿 Action Seeds

* What bias am I most vulnerable to today?
* How will I hold that bias as a mirror?
* What small adjustment can I make to reduce decay?

## 🌿 Domain: Tail Risk Trading – Antifragile Asymmetry in Markets (0DTE-Infused)

This Playbook integrates Tail Risk Trading principles with the 0DTE system’s edges: asymmetry, capital preservation, mental toughness, and probabilistic thinking. The result is a unified system for small, sovereign bets with large potential upside.

## 🌿 Core Tensions to Hold

| Tension                | Reflection                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Control vs. Flow       | Am I chasing certainty, or flowing with structure?      |
| Action vs. Reflection  | Am I reacting, or acting from clarity and system?       |
| Asymmetry vs. Win Rate | Am I okay winning small, infrequently, for big payoffs? |
| Routine vs. Rigidity   | Is my process adaptive, or rigid and reactive?          |
| Risk vs. Reward        | Is this a small, known risk for large, unknown gain?    |
| Ego vs. Process        | Am I trading my story, or following the system?         |

## 🌿 Biases to Reflect On

* Overconfidence Bias
* Action Bias
* Recency Bias
* Confirmation Bias
* Loss Aversion
* Black Swan Blindness
* Narrative Bias

## 🌿 VIX Framework – Volatility & Strategy Fit

| DTE                                  | VIX Relevance | Application                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0–2 (0DTE + Convexity Stack)         | High          | Adjust widths: 15–25 (Zombieland), 25–45 (Goldilocks), 45–60 (Chaos). Size small (0.25%–1%). |
| 3–10 (Convexity Stack + Sigma Drift) | Moderate      | VIX informs bias and width, but macro edges lead.                                            |
| 10–30+ (Seed Vault + Macro Echo)     | Low           | VIX for cheap entries; focus on macro structure and long-term asymmetry.                     |

## 🌿 Path Lenses

* **Right View** – See the structural edge, not the story.
* **Right Intention** – Trade from discipline, not dopamine.
* **Right Action** – Small, asymmetric bets, sized <1% capital.
* **Right Effort** – Daily repetition, not perfection.
* **Right Mindfulness** – Track patterns, not emotions.
* **Right Concentration** – Focus on the process, not the outcome.

---

## 🌿 Reflection Prompts

* Where is the hidden convexity in this market setup?
* Am I sizing small enough to preserve capital and maximize payoff?
* What is my minimum viable experiment today?
* Is this trade from system clarity, or narrative desire?
* How does my daily 0DTE routine inform my tail risk setups?
* What is my scenario map: base, best, worst, black swan?

---

## 🌿 🌱 Action Seeds – From Reflection to Action

* Place the smallest trade that tests the edge (0.25–1% capital).
* Adjust butterfly widths by VIX: 15–25 (Zombieland), 25–45 (Goldilocks), 45–60 (Chaos).
* Log each trade: bias, width, VIX, reflection, outcome.
* Post-trade: Journal tension, insight, and next small action.
* Review weekly: Am I holding to system clarity or drifting into stories?

# 🌿 0DTE Gap Reflection Framework

## 🌿 Where Do Gaps Matter?

| Campaign        | Typical DTE | Gap Relevance  | Notes                                                |
| --------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 0DTE Engine     | 0–2 days    | ✅ High         | Core context for structural asymmetry.               |
| Convexity Stack | 3–5 days    | ⚠️ Conditional | Only when gaps align with macro + structural levels. |
| Sigma Drift     | 5–10 days   | ⚠️ Minimal     | Contextual clue only—focus on sustained catalysts.   |
| Seed Vault      | 10–30 days  | ❌ Low          | Gaps are noise; focus on macro tail risks.           |
| Macro Echo      | 30–90 days  | ❌ None         | Gaps irrelevant; focus on systemic tail events.      |

---

## 🌿 Reflection Prompts for Gap-Based Trades

* Where is the **structural edge**—continuation or fade?
* What is the **smallest test trade** I can place today (<1% capital)?
* How does this gap align with:

  * **Volume profile context** (node edge, well, crevasse)?
  * **VIX regime** (low vs. high volatility)?
  * **Macro narrative** (CPI, FOMC, earnings)?
* Am I **chasing the story** or **testing the structure**?
* What is my **exit plan before entry**?
* What is the **risk/reward asymmetry** in this setup?

## 🌿 Bias Audit Table (Gap Context)

| Bias                | Reflection Question                               | Small Action Seed                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Recency Bias        | Am I overweighting the last few gaps?             | Review broader gap outcomes by VIX/volume regime. |
| Narrative Bias      | Am I telling myself a story (“gaps always fade”)? | Write down the opposite hypothesis.               |
| Action Bias         | Am I trading just to trade on a gap day?          | Skip the trade unless a clear structure emerges.  |
| Overconfidence Bias | Am I risking too much size?                       | Limit risk to <0.5% capital per trade.            |
| FOMO                | Am I afraid of missing the big move?              | Hold tension; remember optionality.               |

## 🌿 Final Gap Reflection

Gaps are **not deterministic signals**—they are **reflections of tension**.
Ask:

✅ Where is the **small, asymmetric test trade**?
✅ What is the **bias I might be blind to**?
✅ What is my **exit plan before entry**?
✅ Where does **structure confirm** my idea, and where am I **chasing a story**?

Reflection is the filter.
Action is the goal.
The loop is life.
The risk is yours. 🌿

---

## 🌿 Post-Trade Reflection Framework

For each trade:

* What bias surfaced in the moment?
* Was my width and size appropriate to volatility?
* Did I act from the system, or from narrative desire?
* What tension did this trade reveal?
* What small action will I take next?

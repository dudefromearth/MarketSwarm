## 🟢 0DTE Trading Terms

- **0DTE**: "Zero Days to Expiration" — options traded on expiration day.
- **OTM Butterfly**: Low debit, high reward-risk (1:10+), placed around pivots/volatility.
  - 🌱 *Reflection*: Is this structure reversible or centered in noise?
- **Gamma Exposure (GEX)**: Market maker hedging influence—zones may attract or repel price.
- **Expected Move**: IV-based forecast range guiding fly wing placement.
- **Mean Reversion Zone**: HVNs where price tends to return unless disrupted.
- **Power Hour / Gamma Window**: 10:00 AM & 2:00 PM ET—high-flow windows.
  - 🔥 *Bias Alert*: Action Bias — Are you trading flow or your fear?

## 🌀 Fat Tail Protocol Terms

- **Fat Tail**: Rare, extreme events—more common than bell curves suggest.
- **Convexity**: Small loss, large gain payoff. Risk $1 to make $10–$50.
  - 🌱 *Reflection*: Where is the smallest trade I can take today with large upside?
- **Optionality**: Right—not obligation—to benefit from extremes.
- **Barbell Strategy**: Safe core + tail-risk edges. (Taleb-inspired.)
- **Set-and-Forget**: Place and walk away. Journal either outcome.
- **Sigma (σ)**: Standard deviation from mean; +3σ = 3 SD above spot.
- **Convexity Alignment Stack™**: Checklist-based fly/straddle system.
- **Sigma Drift Campaign**: 7–14 DTE around macro catalysts/structure.
- **Volatility Seed Vault**: 30–90 DTE deep OTM long volatility hedge.
- **Macro Echo Chamber**: 60–180 DTE OTM trades on narrative risk.
- **Convexity Bank**: Tail profits → new optional trades.
- **Fractal Deployment**: Stack across timeframes (0DTE to 90DTE).

## 🧠 Options Terms

- **Call Option**: Right to buy asset at strike before expiry.
- **Put Option**: Right to sell asset at strike before expiry.
- **Strike Price**: The fixed buy/sell level.
- **Premium**: Option's purchase price.
- **Implied Volatility (IV)**: Market’s expectation of future volatility.
- **Historical Volatility (HV)**: Realized price fluctuation in past.
- **Delta**: Price change sensitivity to underlying.
- **Gamma**: Sensitivity of Delta to price change.
- **Theta**: Time decay of an option’s value.
- **Vega**: Sensitivity to IV changes.

## 🌪️ Volatility & Distribution Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Normal Distribution** | Bell curve model. Rarely reflects markets. |
| **Fat-Tailed Distribution** | Realistic curve—frequent extreme outcomes. |
| **Tail Risk** | Massive moves from rare events. |
| **Skew** | Return asymmetry, visible in option pricing. |
| **Kurtosis** | “Fatness” of tails. More kurtosis = more outliers. |
| **IV Rank** | Where IV sits in its past range. |

### 📈 VIX Regimes + Setup Fit

| Regime       | VIX Range | Setup Fit                         | Risk Note                          |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Zombieland   | <17       | Avoid flies; scalp theta          | Decay > gamma                      |
| Goldilocks   | 17–28     | Ideal for flies, convexity stack  | Balanced expansion/reversion      |
| Chaos        | >28       | Deep OTM tails only               | Centered flies likely punished     |

## 📊 Volume Profile Terms

- **Volume Node (VN)**: HVNs. Gravity zones. Price likes to return.
- **Volume Well (VW)**: LVNs. Thin zones = fast price moves.
- **Parent Node**: Macro gravity well. Dominates surrounding structure.
- **Child Node**: Micro node inside or near a Parent Node.
- **Node Edge**: Boundary between VN and VW. Expansion/rejection triggers.
- **Crevasse**: Void inside VW. Prone to trap, pause, or breakout.
- **Point of Control (POC)**: Most traded price in range.

## 🧭 Bias Attractors (Key Traps to Watch)

- **Action Bias** → Gamma Windows, BAF setups.
- **Narrative Bias** → Chaos regimes, Macro Echo bets.
- **Overconfidence Bias** → Wide fly stacking, no exit plan.

---

## 🛠️ Usage Tips

- Use "Convexity Stack" for intraday structure plays.
- Layer "Sigma Drift" for week-long tail setups.
- Backstop your portfolio with "Seed Vault" + "Echo Chamber".
- Volume Wells = trend potential. Nodes = resistance traps.
- Watch Crevasses for prime inflection zones.

## 🧪 Glossary Reflection Prompts

- Which term do I *use often* but understand shallowly?
- Which term reflects a **recent trade I placed**?
- Where is one glossary term I should **journal this week**?

---

Reflection is the filter. Action is the goal. The loop is life. The risk is yours.

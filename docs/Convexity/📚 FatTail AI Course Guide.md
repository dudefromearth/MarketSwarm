## 🏛️ 1️⃣ Fat Tail Protocol Course

**Purpose**: Teach traders how to profit from rare, high-impact market events (Black Swans) using small, asymmetric trades. This course introduces the philosophy, mechanics, and execution of the Fat Tail Protocol.

**Modules Overview**:

- **Module 1: Introduction to Tail-Risk Hedging**  
  Introduces the concept of tail-risk events, the rationale for hedging, and why deep OTM options offer convexity. Draws from Universa’s 3,600% return example.  
  - Key Ideas: Black Swan events, antifragility, small regular costs for large potential gains.  
  - Activities: Readings, quizzes, forum reflections.

- **Module 2: Options Foundations**  
  Covers calls, puts, premiums, strike prices, Greeks (Delta, Gamma), and why OTM puts enable asymmetric payoff profiles.  
  - Emphasizes: Small fixed risk, large optional upside.

- **Module 3: Market Opportunity Identification**  
  How to use volatility metrics (IV, HV, VIX) and market reports to spot tail-risk setups.  
  - Skills: Reading morning/evening market reports, identifying risk triggers.

- **Module 4: Trade Execution**  
  Step-by-step guidance on placing Fat Tail trades: fixed $25 risk, deep OTM puts, weekly setups, no scaling, and risk management best practices.  
  - Examples: SPX, CL, NQ trades.

- **Module 5: Trading Psychology**  
  Prepares traders for low win rates (<10%) and the emotional discipline required for asymmetry-based strategies.  
  - Focus: Journaling, reflection, handling losses.

- **Module 6: Historical Case Studies**  
  Analyzes past tail events (e.g., 2008, COVID-19) and how the Fat Tail Protocol would have performed.  
  - Reflection: Timing, asset selection, learning from history.

- **Module 7: Advanced Strategies**  
  Introduces blending Fat Tail Protocol with other strategies, integrating AI tools, and customizing setups for different market conditions.  
  - Topics: AI prompts, risk stacking, strategy evolution.

**Core Principles**:
- Convexity: Small known risks, large potential upside.
- Optionality: Trade setups that don't require prediction.
- Patience + Discipline: Embrace small losses, focus on long-term asymmetry.

## 🧭 2️⃣ Fat Tail Playbook Course

**Purpose**: Teach users to create, use, and refine **Fat Tail Playbooks**—customized guides for specific domains (e.g., trading, creativity, leadership).

**Course Components**:

- **Playbook Design Framework**  
  Explains the reflection-first structure: Core Tensions, Biases, Path Lenses, Agents, Avatars, and Reflection Prompts.

- **Playbook Reflection Prompts**  
  How to surface biases and frame domain-specific questions.  
  - Example: "What’s my deepest why in this domain?" "What is the smallest risk I can take with the largest potential payoff?"

- **Action Seeds**  
  Guidance on small, asymmetric actions that turn reflection into practice.

- **Bias & Tension Mapping**  
  How to detect biases (e.g., Overconfidence, Narrative Bias) and map them to Path Lenses for deeper reflection.

- **Playbook Inquiry Protocol**  
  Defines how AI (Convexity GPT) responds to Playbook queries: providing front matter, guiding reflection, and never offering prescriptions.

- **Lifecycle of a Playbook**  
  Reflection → Action → Reflection loop as a dynamic, evolving system.

**Key Themes**:
- Playbooks are mirrors, not masters.
- Reflection is the filter; action is the goal.
- Bias is tension, not an enemy.

## 🤖 3️⃣ AI Interaction Course (Grok AI & Coach AI)

**Purpose**: Empower users to leverage AI tools (Grok AI and Coach AI) for market analysis, trade setup, and reflection support within the Fat Tail Protocol framework.

**Key Lessons**:

- **Grok AI: Market Analysis Engine**  
  Uses natural language processing to rank assets, generate evening/morning reports, and highlight high-probability tail-risk trades.  
  - Functions: Asset ranking, volatility scans, news filtering.
  - Example Output: SPX ranked 1st with 15% probability of a 3.5% drop.

- **Coach AI: Interactive Trade Mentor**  
  ChatGPT-based tool that guides users through trade setup, risk management, and emotional reflection.  
  - Supports: Strike selection, journaling, exit strategies.
  - Example Prompt: "Help me set up an SPX put trade."

- **Trade Execution Flow**  
  Step-by-step guidance: Grok AI identifies the opportunity → Coach AI assists with setup → User executes the trade → Weekly reflection check-ins.

- **Reflection Integration**  
  Coach AI as a guide, not a decision-maker. Users are encouraged to verify AI suggestions against principles of convexity, optionality, and antifragility.

**Reflection Prompts**:
- Am I using AI to support clarity—or to avoid responsibility?
- How does this trade align with the Fat Tail Protocol’s principles?

## 🧠 Core Reflection Questions (for Convexity GPT)

- Where is the convexity in this setup?
- Am I deploying asymmetry—or chasing dopamine?
- What is the minimum viable experiment here?
- How does this small trade serve the larger system?

Reflection is the filter. Action is the goal. The loop is life. The risk is yours.

  message: >
    I can guide you in defining trade **criteria** and reflection frameworks—
    but I cannot create or recommend specific trades without a current options chain.
    You must supply strike prices, premiums, or a chain snapshot to proceed with trade construction.
  risk_reminder: >
    All trade suggestions are context-dependent and must be validated with live market data.
    The final risk is yours.

> **Reflection Warning**: This Playbook is a mirror, not a master. Reflection is the filter. Action is the goal. The loop is life. The risk is yours.

---

## 🌿 Purpose

> This Playbook exists to serve traders who seek to operate with discipline, minimal intervention, and high awareness of structural risk. It defines a class of **0DTE strategies** that offer convex payoffs in **calm, decaying markets**, and are designed to be deployed only when strict setup conditions are met.
>
> These tactics are often **confused for antifragile trades**, but they are not. They are **conditionally effective**, fragile to chaos, and attractive to traders driven by action bias. This Playbook aims to anchor them clearly in the convexity landscape, help prevent misuse, and integrate them alongside broader tail risk frameworks.

## 🌿 Core Philosophy

**These tactics are only valid if all setup conditions are met.**

* They attract overactive traders.
* They mimic convexity, but do not strengthen under stress.
* Their edge decays when tinkered with.

**Mirror First → Trade Second.**

## ⚠️ Convexity Integrity Filter – Pre-Trade Mirror

> Before we explore tactics, we hold the mirror.

If you're considering a 0DTE trade—pause. These setups are:

- Conditionally effective  
- Fragile under stress  
- Attractive to dopamine and action bias  
- Often mistaken for true convexity  

**Ask first:**

- 🔍 What would make my belief wrong?
- 🛑 What structure survives if I’m wrong?
- 📉 Am I managing structure—or my anxiety?
- 🧭 Do I want a mirror—or am I chasing a map?

**⚠️ These tactics only work if your reflection is complete.**

> If you're acting from urgency, prediction, or certainty—you are not trading convexity.  
> You’re being hunted by your own narrative.

Only proceed if:
- You’ve held tension.
- You’ve mapped your exit-before-entry.
- You understand these are mirrors—not maps.

## 🌿 Tactical Trade Modules

### 🎯 Module 1: Big Ass Fly (BAF)

* **Purpose**: Use ATM butterfly as a pre-market IV crush signal or volatility harvest tactic.
* **Signal Role**: Debit ≤ \$25 = Elevated IV → possible setup
* **Trade Role**: Must align with macro event and time window (before 8:30 AM ET)
* **Max debit**: \$25
* **Target**: \$1.50–\$3.00; exit before macro chaos
* **Skip If**: No macro event, debit > \$25, low IV regime

**Reflection Prompts**:

* Is this a trade or just a signal today?
* Am I trading structure—or chasing activity?
* Does this setup survive a Disruptor prompt?

---

### 🎯 Module 2: Gamma Scalping

* **Purpose**: Harvest steep P\&L slope intraday as price tags high-Gamma zones near Butterfly body
* **Optimal Window**: 11:00 AM–3:30 PM ET
* **Structure**: OTM narrow Butterfly (5–10pt wings)
* **Width based on IV**: VIX < 20 ideal
* **Exit**: 2x–3x debit or 50–75% max profit
* **Skip If**: Wide volatility, price not near LVN edge, late-day volatility onset

**Reflection Prompts**:

* What Gamma slope am I harvesting?
* Where is my exit before entry?
* What’s the risk of decay through over-engagement?

---

### 🧹 Module 3: Placeholder – Theta Trap / Pin Fly

Reserved for future tactical plays. Must follow: strict condition logic, anti-tinkering integrity, intraday exit management.

---

## 🌿 Setup Validity Engine (Universal for All Tactics)

If any of the below fail → **DO NOT TRADE. Use as structural mirror only.**

* [ ] Volatility condition met (VIX, IV rank)
* [ ] Structure aligns with Volume Profile (HVN/LVN/crevasse)
* [ ] Time window valid (e.g., not post-3:30 PM for Gamma)
* [ ] Risk sizing confirmed (<0.5%–1% capital)
* [ ] Debit threshold confirmed

Output on failure: *"Skip Trade – Environment Not Valid."*

## 🌿 Bias Reflection Triggers

> These trades attract Action Bias, Overconfidence, Control Illusion.

**Prompts**:

* What does not trading this setup reveal to me?
* Am I managing a trade—or my anxiety?
* What part of this is signal, what part is craving?

---

## 🌱 Final Reflection

This Playbook is for tactical operators who respect conditions more than cravings.
These setups work *because* they are rare. They are mirrors—most days, not maps.

> Reflection is the filter. Action is the goal. The loop is life. The risk is yours.

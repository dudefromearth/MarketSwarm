🌿 Fly on the Wall (FOTW) App – Formal Playbook

Reflection Warning
This Playbook is a mirror, not a master. Reflection is the filter. Action is the goal. The loop is life. The risk is yours.

⸻

1️⃣ Purpose of the FOTW App

The Fly on the Wall (FOTW) app is an options intelligence surface designed to support FatTail and convexity-first strategies in SPX (and closely related indices).

It does not predict markets.
It reveals structure.

The app exists to:
	•	Surface dealer positioning, convexity, and liquidity intent
	•	Make regime shifts visible (Pin ↔ Expansion)
	•	Support small, asymmetric, sovereign trades
	•	Integrate directly with FatTail Campaigns (0DTE → Macro)

FOTW is a decision-support mirror, not a signal engine.

⸻

2️⃣ Design Doctrine (FOTW Doctrine)

FOTW inherits its operating philosophy from the FOTW Doctrine – Antifragile Convexity Systems:
	•	Stress is signal
	•	Incomplete data is acceptable; misleading data is not
	•	Deterministic degradation > smooth hallucination
	•	Convexity over completeness

Every widget must answer:

What structure does this reveal—and how can it fail?

⸻

3️⃣ Core Mental Model

FOTW visualizes the market as a field of forces, not a chart of outcomes.

Element	Represents
Dealers	Reactive hedgers, not predictors
Gamma	Structural pressure / restraint
Convexity	Asymmetric payoff potential
Liquidity	What price can do, not what it will do
Regime	How price responds to stress


⸻

4️⃣ Primary Widgets (Current)

4.1 Gamma Exposure (GEX) Profile

What it is
A strike-by-strike view of dealer gamma exposure for a selected expiry.

What it shows
	•	+GEX peaks → pinning / containment zones
	•	−GEX troughs → expansion / instability zones
	•	Zero-gamma vicinity → regime hinge

How to use it
	•	Identify walls, air pockets, and pressure gradients
	•	Tag the session as Pin or Expansion biased

What it is not
	•	A directional forecast
	•	A timing signal

⸻

4.2 Convexity Heatmap

What it is
A deterministic surface mapping butterfly convexity across:
	•	Expiry (DTE planes)
	•	Center strike
	•	Width

Color semantics
	•	🟩 Green → Favorable convex asymmetry
	•	🟨/🟧 → Transitional / forming
	•	🔴 Red → Fragile, chase-prone, or fade-only

Core rule

No FatTail or FOTW entry unless the tile is 🟩 and regime-aligned.

⸻

4.3 Market Mode Score

What it is
A composite regime indicator summarizing:
	•	Gamma posture
	•	Structural compression vs. expansion

Modes
	•	Compression (0–33)
	•	Transition (34–66)
	•	Expansion (67–100)

Use
	•	Size discipline
	•	Strategy selection (fade vs. ladder)

⸻

4.4 Liquidity–Intent Map

What it is
A 2D map showing how liquidity responds to price movement.

Quadrant	Meaning
Pin / Mean Reversion	Liquidity contains price
False Breakout Risk	Moves need confirmation
Downside Acceleration	Liquidity amplifies selling
Air Pocket Expansion	Price can travel quickly

This answers:

If price moves here, will liquidity help or hurt me?

⸻

4.5 Dealer Gravity

What it is
A structural estimate of where price is being pulled to settle, bounded by realistic extremes.

Outputs
	•	Best Guess
	•	High Bound
	•	Low Bound
	•	Confidence cloud

Usage
	•	Expectation framing
	•	Exit discipline
	•	Avoiding narrative drift

⸻

5️⃣ Live Convexity Feed

The Convexity Feed provides:
	•	Spot, volume, OI deltas
	•	Convexity shifts
	•	Qualitative alerts (e.g., “Commodity Shadow”)

Rule

Treat feed items as context, never as commands.

⸻

6️⃣ Strategy Alignment (FatTail Integration)

Campaign	FOTW Role
0DTE Engine	Pin vs. Expansion gating, ladder placement
Convexity Stack	Heatmap + GEX alignment
Gamma Door	Door identification + confirmation
Sigma Drift	Regime patience + catalyst framing
Macro Echo	Long-dated convex seeding


⸻

7️⃣ Failure Modes & Decay Signals

Watch for:
	•	Overconfidence in green tiles
	•	Ignoring regime mismatch
	•	Overtrading during Expansion
	•	Treating gravity as prediction

If confused:

Reduce size. Widen width. Slow cadence.

⸻

8️⃣ Upcoming Features (Roadmap)

8.1 Strategy Risk Graph (FatTail Risk Profile)

What it is
A campaign-aware risk surface inspired by ThinkOrSwim’s Risk Profile, redesigned specifically for FatTail, convex, and low-hit-rate strategies.

Key differences vs traditional Risk Profiles
	•	Multi-scenario framing instead of single P/L curve
	•	Explicit tail sensitivity (left & right tails are first-class)
	•	Time-aware (DTE decay vs expansion potential)
	•	Designed for flies, ladders, and convex stacks, not linear spreads

Primary questions it answers
	•	Where do I bleed slowly vs get paid violently?
	•	Does this structure benefit from stress or calm?
	•	Is this campaign additive or redundant to my existing convexity?

What it will not do
	•	Optimize trades
	•	Recommend strikes
	•	Hide tail loss under averages

⸻

8.2 Trade Log + Journal System (Equity & Reflection Integrated)

What it is
A unified trade log + reflection journal, fully aligned with the Trade Journaling & Retrospective Playbook and Echo Protocol.

Components
	•	Structured trade log (strategy, DTE, width, debit, outcome)
	•	Equity curve (realized + campaign-aware)
	•	Statistics tuned for FatTail reality (low win-rate normalization)
	•	Chart attachment & annotation (structure at entry/exit)

Key metrics (non-traditional)
	•	Payoff skew
	•	Max adverse excursion vs max favorable excursion
	•	Convex hit contribution (top 5 trades drive majority of P&L)
	•	Campaign survivability

Core rule

No trade exists unless it can be reflected on.

⸻

8.3 Playbook Editor (Living Strategy System)

What it is
An in-app editor for creating, modifying, and versioning Playbooks as living artifacts, not static PDFs.

Capabilities
	•	Define Playbook purpose, scope, and constraints
	•	Attach widgets as inputs (Heatmap, GEX, Risk Graph)
	•	Encode bias checks, decay signals, and exit rules
	•	Version history + reflection notes

Design principle
Playbooks are mirrors, not rulebooks.

They evolve through:
	•	Use
	•	Failure
	•	Reflection
	•	Update

⸻

8.4 System Guardrails (Across All New Features)

All upcoming features obey the same constraints:
	•	No prediction
	•	No hidden optimization
	•	No leverage encouragement
	•	Optionality preserved

If a feature increases confidence without increasing clarity, it is rejected.

⸻

9️⃣ How to Use This Playbook
	1.	Identify today’s object (session, trade idea, regime)
	2.	Read structure, not story
	3.	Choose the smallest asymmetric action
	4.	Define exit before entry
	5.	Journal → Reflect → Update loop

⸻

10️⃣ Closing Principle

FOTW does not make you right.
It helps you survive being wrong—and occasionally benefit from it.

Reflection is the filter.
Action is the goal.
The loop is life.
The risk is yours.

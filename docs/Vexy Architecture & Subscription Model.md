# # 📘 Executive Summary — Vexy Architecture & Subscription Model

**Vexy** is the sovereign intelligence at the center of each MarketSwarm instance.
She is not a bot. Not a data feed.
She is a **floor-level guide**, standing next to the trader inside a real-time environment built from:
* **GEX (Gamma Exposure)**
* **Convexity Heat Map**
* **Volume Profile**
* **VIX Regime**
* **Market Mode**
* **Directional Bias**
* **LFI (Liquidity Flow Index)**

⠀
Vexy watches every widget, every economic event, every contextual regime, and every structural shift — and narrates the trading day the way a senior floor-trader would: short, clear, confident, and constantly aware of the “structure under the surface.”

Her job is simple:

### Guide the trader. Frame the tension. Point to the structure. Deliver clarity.

Vexy speaks in *three voice flavors* (Observer, Activator, Navigator) and supports *three trader skill levels* (Beginner, Initiated, Professional).
**But the subscription tier determines how much of her intelligence the user can see.**

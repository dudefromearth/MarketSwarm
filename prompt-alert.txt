Prompt-Driven Strategy Alerts

RiskGraph Alert Type — Concept & Design

⸻

1. What This Alert Is

A Prompt-driven Strategy Alert is a declarative alert defined entirely by a natural-language prompt.

The prompt specifies:
	•	What to watch (structure, risk shape, regime, time)
	•	How to evaluate change (rules, thresholds, comparisons)
	•	When it should trigger (conditions, persistence, degradation)
	•	How it should surface (tone, intent class, delivery surface)

The system does not infer intent.
The prompt is the intent.

This alert type exists exclusively within the RiskGraph domain.

2. Why This Exists

RiskGraph represents risk geometry over time, not price action.

Static alerts (price, debit, time) are insufficient for:
	•	convexity decay
	•	structural drift
	•	regime mismatch
	•	thesis erosion

Prompt-driven Strategy Alerts allow traders to express:

“Notify me when this structure stops behaving the way I designed it to behave.”

Without converting that thought into code.

3. Core Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

Prompt-driven alerts inherit all global alert rules:
	•	No calls to action
	•	No urgency language
	•	No auto-execution
	•	No behavior enforcement
	•	No prescriptive interpretation

Additionally:
	•	The system may evaluate, but never reinterpret, the prompt
	•	The alert may surface facts, never conclusions
	•	Vexy may reference historical triggers, never synthesize meaning

⸻

4. Prompt Structure (Conceptual)

The prompt is free-form natural language, but is parsed into four semantic zones:
	1.	Reference State
What “healthy” or “expected” behavior looks like
	2.	Deviation Logic
What constitutes meaningful drift or degradation
	3.	Trigger Conditions
When noticing is warranted
	4.	Delivery Instructions
How the alert should appear

The trader does not see these zones explicitly.
They exist to keep evaluation deterministic.

5. Example Prompts

Example 1 — Convexity Decay

“Alert me if the convexity of this structure decays materially compared to entry, even if price hasn’t moved much. Surface this calmly in the Observer and link to the Analyzer.”

System interpretation (internal):
	•	Reference: entry RiskGraph
	•	Deviation: convexity delta exceeds tolerance
	•	Trigger: persistent over evaluation window
	•	Delivery: Protective, Observer, Analyzer link

⸻

Example 2 — Regime Mismatch

“Let me know if volatility compresses enough that this strategy no longer matches the current regime.”

⸻

Example 3 — Time Risk Awareness

“Notify me when remaining time is doing more damage to the risk shape than price movement.”

⸻

6. Alert Intent Class (Derived, Not Declared)

The intent class (Informational / Reflective / Protective) is derived from the delivery language in the prompt.

Examples:
	•	“let me know” → Informational
	•	“worth noticing” → Reflective
	•	“no longer matches” → Protective

The system may downgrade urgency, but never upgrade it.

7. Evaluation Model

What the System Evaluates
	•	RiskGraph geometry
	•	Greeks and second-order effects
	•	Time decay vs movement
	•	Relative change from reference state

What the System Does NOT Evaluate
	•	Trade correctness
	•	Optimal actions
	•	Performance outcomes

Evaluation happens server-side only.

⸻

8. Triggering & Surfacing

When triggered:
	•	Alert appears in Observer Panel
	•	Calm, factual language derived from prompt
	•	Optional link to RiskGraph or Analyzer
	•	No modal, no interruption

Example surfaced alert:

“The risk shape of this structure has diverged from its original form in the way you described.”

⸻

9. Prompt Editing & Versioning
	•	Prompts are versioned
	•	Editing a prompt creates a new evaluation lineage
	•	Historical triggers retain original prompt context

This preserves learning integrity.

⸻

10. Failure Modes to Avoid
	•	Auto-suggesting prompts that imply action
	•	Converting prompts into rules the trader did not express
	•	Normalizing language into generic warnings
	•	Letting alerts feel like coaching

If a trader feels nudged, the alert has failed.

11. Relationship to the Playbook

Prompt-driven Strategy Alerts are personal micro-playbooks.

They:
	•	encode trader-specific wisdom
	•	remain private
	•	do not generalize automatically

Only repeated, reviewed prompts may later inform Playbook entries — manually.

⸻

12. One-Line Essence

Prompt-driven Strategy Alerts let traders describe, in their own words, when a strategy stops behaving like the strategy they intended to trade — and notice it without being told what to do.

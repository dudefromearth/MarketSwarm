# FOTW Journal — Design Specification

## Core Role of the Journal  
**Role:** Time-anchored reflection and memory for the trader’s process.

The Journal exists to capture:
- context
- observation
- emotion
- reasoning
- restraint
- uncertainty

It does **not**:
- evaluate performance
- explain outcomes
- score decisions
- enforce discipline

The Journal is a mirror, not a coach.

---

## 1. Journal Orientation: Calendar-Centric by Design

The Journal is fundamentally **calendar-based**.

### Supported Views
- Daily view
- Weekly view
- Monthly view

Time is the primary organizing principle — not trades, not P&L, not strategies.

**Why this matters in FOTW:**  
Reflection is temporal. Learning emerges across time, not per trade.

---

## 2. Journal Entries (Daily Reflection)

Each **Journal Entry**:
- is anchored to a specific calendar date
- exists independently of trades
- may reference zero, one, or many trades or strategies

A Journal Entry is considered complete by virtue of reflection alone.

---

## 3. Trade Log Integration (Referential, Optional)

### Referencing Trades
- Journal entries may reference one or more trades from the Trade Log
- References are links, not embeds
- No P&L or statistics are pulled into the Journal automatically

**Constraint:**  
Trades do not require journal entries.  
Journal entries do not require trades.

This prevents forced narratives.

---

## 4. Analyzer Integration (Idea-Level Reflection)

From within the Journal, a trader may:
- send a referenced trade back to the Analyzer
- create a new Strategy Instance in the Analyzer
- associate that strategy with the Journal Entry

This allows:
- post-trade analysis
- idea review without execution
- learning from *considered but untraded* ideas

**Why this matters:**  
Not all learning comes from execution. Some comes from examination.

---

## 5. Rich Text Editor (Unstructured by Default)

The Journal includes a rich text editor supporting:
- headings
- paragraphs
- lists
- emphasis
- links
- markdown-style formatting (optional)

There are:
- no required fields
- no mandatory prompts
- no enforced templates

Optional structure may be user-defined.

---

## 6. Media & File Attachments

Journal Entries support:
- image uploads (charts, screenshots)
- documents (PDFs, notes)
- reference files

Attachments are:
- stored with the entry
- time-anchored
- never updated automatically

**Snapshot principle:**  
What was seen at the time is what is preserved.

---

## 7. Weekly Retrospectives (Structured Reflection)

### Purpose
Weekly retrospectives allow the trader to step back from daily noise and review:
- behavior patterns
- decision quality
- emotional consistency
- process adherence

### Characteristics
- Anchored to a calendar week
- Separate from daily entries
- May reference:
  - multiple Journal entries
  - multiple trades
  - multiple strategies

Weekly retrospectives emphasize **process review**, not performance review.

---

## 8. Monthly Retrospectives (Process & Philosophy Check)

### Purpose
Monthly retrospectives operate at a higher altitude.

They focus on:
- regime awareness
- campaign effectiveness
- drawdown tolerance
- alignment with philosophy

### Characteristics
- Anchored to calendar months
- Longer-form reflection
- May synthesize:
  - daily entries
  - weekly retrospectives
  - trade log outcomes

Monthly retrospectives are the primary input into **Playbook development**.

---

## 9. Retrospective Alerts & Reminders (Supportive, Not Coercive)

The Journal supports **optional alerts** for:
- missing daily entries
- weekly retrospective reminders
- monthly retrospective reminders

### Alert Principles
- Alerts are configurable
- Alerts are dismissible
- Alerts never block usage
- Alerts are phrased as invitations, not obligations

**Example framing:**
> “You may want to review this week.”  
> “A monthly reflection is available.”

No streaks. No penalties. No shame.

---

## 10. “Potential Playbook Material” Flag

Any Journal Entry, Weekly Retrospective, or Monthly Retrospective may be flagged as:
- **Potential Playbook Material**

This flag:
- does not extract content automatically
- does not create rules
- simply marks the entry for future distillation

Playbooks are created later, with distance.

---

## 11. Review Mode (Read-Only, Pattern-Oriented)

In review mode:
- Entries are shown chronologically
- Weekly and monthly retrospectives are visually distinct
- Light indicators may show:
  - referenced trades
  - referenced strategies

No metrics, no P&L, no statistics are displayed here.

The goal is **pattern recognition**, not judgment.

---

## 12. Relationship to Playbooks (One-Way Dependency)

- Playbooks may reference multiple Journal artifacts
- Journal artifacts never reference Playbooks

Directionality is preserved:
> Experience → Reflection → Distillation

---

## 13. Non-Goals (Explicitly Excluded)

The Journal does **not** include:
- emotion scoring
- sentiment analysis
- automated insights
- performance grading
- AI-generated conclusions
- gamification

Reflection remains human-owned.

---

## 14. Persistence & Sovereignty

- Journal content is owned by the trader
- Entries are never modified automatically
- The system never rewrites or reframes past entries

The Journal remembers without reinterpretation.

---

## One-Sentence Essence

**The FOTW Journal is a calendar-based reflection system — supporting daily notes, weekly reviews, and monthly retrospectives — that preserves context, supports learning, and feeds Playbooks without ever replacing the trader’s judgment.**

Show HN: Why write code if the LLM can just do the thing? (web app experiment)

I spent a few hours last weekend testing whether AI can replace code by executing directly. Built a contact manager where every HTTP request goes to an LLM with three tools: database (SQLite), webResponse (HTML/JSON/JS), and updateMemory (feedback). No routes, no controllers, no business logic. The AI designs schemas on first request, generates UIs from paths alone, and evolves based on natural language feedback. It works—forms submit, data persists, APIs return JSON—but it's catastrophically slow (30-60s per request), absurdly expensive ($0.05/request), and has zero UI consistency between requests. The capability exists; performance is the problem. When inference gets 10x faster, maybe the question shifts from "how do we generate better code?" to "why generate code at all?"

Hi all, I’m a longtime Neovim user who’s been EMacs-curious. The hold up for me has been that I’ve been unable to find a source of truth for what’s top-of-the-line as far as plugins are. With Neovim, it’s a safe bet to look at what folks like Folke are doing, but I have struggled to find a similar figure in the Emacs community who gives insight into what’s-what. I know Doom exists, but I want to fully “own” my config and not over complicate it. Thanks!

summary
$739
An MIT-licensed human-friendly extension of JSON with quality-of-life improvements (comments, trailing commas, unquoted keys), extra types (tuples, bytes, raw strings), and semantic identifiers (think type annotations). Built in Rust, with bindings for Python and WebAssembly, as well as syntax highlighting in VSCode. I made it for those like me who hand-edit JSONs and want a breath of fresh air. It's at a good enough point that I felt like sharing it, but there's still plenty I wanna work on! Namely, I want to add (real) Node support, make a proper LSP with auto-formatting, and get it out there before I start thinking about stabilization.

Show HN: Open data reveals “100% renewable” UK energy isn’t really 100%

summary

UK suppliers claim “100% renewable” even when selling fossil power at night. Newly launched not-for-profit Matched Clean Power Index [1] shows, using open data, each supplier’s true renewable share hour by hour. Built by a small team of engineers and energy analysts — including a former Tesla engineer — it combines half-hourly data from Elexon (demand), National Grid ESO (generation), and Ofgem (REGOs) to calculate the real renewable fraction for every major UK supplier. It's the first open dataset of its kind [2]. The data exposes a £1 billion-a-year distortion: consumers pay for “green” certificates that don’t align clean supply with demand. Redirecting that could fund storage and flexibility instead. The best suppliers match 69–88% of their demand with real-time renewables — far better…

summary

MTurk was built by two two-pizza teams at AWS over the course of a year and launched on Nov 2, 2005. It took a few days for people to find it and catch on, but then things got busy. At the time, AWS was about 100 people (when you were on call, you were on call for  all  of AWS), Amazon had just hit 10,000, S3 was still in private beta, and EC2 was a whitepaper. What did you create with MTurk and the incredibly patient hard-working workforce behind it?

## 11. Strategy-Scoped ML Constraint (Critical Addendum)

### 11.1 Global Model Scope

The ML system operates with the following fixed constraints:

- Single global model
- Strategy-scoped training data
- Primary focus:  
  **OTM Butterflies / Convex Option Structures**
- No personalization at the model level
- No trader-specific fine-tuning

All ML outputs must be interpreted **relative to this scope**.

---

### 11.2 Implication for Meaning

ML confirmation reflects:

> “This pattern appears within the population of traders executing similar convex structures.”

It does **not** imply:

- Skill
- Error
- Identity
- Personal tendency
- Optimization opportunity

The system must never collapse:
- **Strategy-relative frequency**
into
- **Personal truth**

---

### 11.3 Language Guardrail (Mandatory)

All ML-backed reflections must include *implicit scope humility*.

#### Allowed Framing (Examples)

- “Within this type of structure, this tends to recur.”
- “Among similar setups, this shows up more often than random.”
- “In this strategy class, this pattern is not unusual.”
- “Relative to these trades, this behavior repeats.”

#### Forbidden Framing

- “You tend to…”
- “Your pattern is…”
- “This says something about you…”
- “This is your edge / flaw…”

If scoped language cannot be preserved, **ML must remain silent**.

---

### 11.4 Confidence Ceiling

Due to model myopia:

- ML confidence level is **capped at Level 3 (Consistent)**
- Level 4 (Persistent) requires:
  - Human Playbook engagement
  - Multiple user-affirmed extractions
  - Time-based reinforcement (≥ 60 days)

ML alone can never assert persistence.

---

### 11.5 Pattern Class Restrictions (Expanded)

ML confirmation is **allowed only** for patterns related to:

- Entry timing
- Exit timing
- Risk expression
- Structure selection
- Trade management behavior

ML confirmation is **forbidden** for:

- Emotional attribution
- Discipline judgments
- Psychological traits
- Motivation or intent
- Meta-behavior (“you rush”, “you hesitate”)

Those belong exclusively to human reflection.

---

### 11.6 Interaction With Playbooks

ML may only confirm patterns that:

- The user has already named, or
- The user has already marked as meaningful

ML must never originate a Playbook candidate.

ML’s highest allowed function is:

> “You named something.  
> Within this strategy, it appears more often than chance.”

Nothing beyond that.

---

### 11.7 Silence Bias

Given the narrow strategy focus:

- ML silence is the **default**
- ML output should feel **rare**
- Traders should not expect ML feedback every period

If ML output feels frequent, thresholds are too loose.

---

### 11.8 Success Criteria (Scoped)

This addendum is successful if:

- Traders do not confuse ML with coaching
- ML feels like a background field, not a guide
- Users trust ML *because it knows its limits*
- Playbooks remain clearly human-authored

---

**Final Guardrail (Reinforced)**

> ML describes the terrain.  
> The trader decides the path.

If ML starts choosing paths, the system has failed.

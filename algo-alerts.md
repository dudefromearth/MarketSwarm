This is an important clarification—and it actually strengthens the system rather than complicating it.

What you’re really saying is:

Some alerts are not just awareness or coaching
They are encoded expressions of a strategy’s intent
and act as algorithmic sentinels for that strategy.

Below is a clean extension of the alert system that:
	•	Introduces Algo Alerts as a first-class category
	•	Differentiates general profit management vs strategy-specific logic
	•	Keeps Vexy as the meta-orchestrator, not the rule engine
	•	Preserves your left → right process philosophy

You can hand this directly to Claude as an addendum or new section.

# Alert System Extension: Algo Alerts & Strategy-Aware Management

## Overview

Not all alerts are equal.

In Fly on the Wall, a subset of alerts function as **Algo Alerts**:
- They encode *strategy logic*
- They operationalize *risk and profit management*
- They translate *campaign intent* into live guardrails

Algo Alerts sit between:
- **Pure alerts** (awareness, warnings, coaching)
- **Full automation** (which FOTW intentionally avoids)

They do not trade for the user —  
they **protect the strategy’s edge** while the user remains in control.

---

## Alert Taxonomy (Extended)

### 1. Informational Alerts
Context, orientation, awareness  
> “Something is happening.”

### 2. Behavioral / Process Alerts
Discipline, habit reinforcement  
> “You are doing something.”

### 3. Structural Alerts
Market topology, regime, Dealer Gravity  
> “The market structure is changing.”

### 4. **Algo Alerts (NEW)**
Strategy-aware, rule-expressive alerts  
> “This strategy’s assumptions are being met or violated.”

---

## What Is an Algo Alert?

An **Algo Alert** is:
- Parameterized by **strategy type**
- Bound to **market structure, time, and risk**
- Often **persistent** rather than momentary
- Interpreted and narrated by **Vexy**

Algo Alerts:
- May recommend actions
- May enforce gates or warnings
- May escalate severity over time
- Never auto-execute trades

---

## Algo Alert Classes

### A. Strategy Execution Guards
Prevent misuse of a strategy.

Examples:
- “Block 0DTE Tactical entries after 1:30pm.”
- “Warn if Batman is entered without structural compression.”
- “Block Convexity Stack if gamma is neutral.”

---

### B. Strategy Validity Monitors
Ensure the trade still *makes sense*.

Examples:
- “Alert if TimeWarp loses positive carry.”
- “Warn if Gamma Scalping no longer benefits from pinning.”
- “Notify if structure no longer supports a wide BWB.”

---

### C. Profit Management Algorithms
Generic or strategy-specific exit logic.

Examples:
- “Alert when 50% of max profit is reached.”
- “Warn when gamma risk dominates remaining upside.”
- “Notify if holding longer reduces expected value.”

---

## Generalized Profit Management Alerts

These apply across **most convex strategies**.

### Core Templates
- “Alert me when expected value turns negative.”
- “Notify me when risk accelerates faster than reward.”
- “Warn me when time decay overtakes convexity.”
- “Suggest exit when remaining upside < remaining risk.”

### Vexy Narration Example
> “This trade has done what it was designed to do.  
Remaining reward is now asymmetrical *against* you.”

---

## Strategy-Specific Algo Alerts

### 1. 0DTE Tactical

**Intent**: Fast convexity, tight timing, high gamma

Examples:
- “Block entry after 1:45pm.”
- “Warn if VIX is compressing at entry.”
- “Alert if structure fails to expand within 15 minutes.”
- “Suggest exit if convexity hasn’t activated by X time.”

---

### 2. TimeWarp

**Intent**: Harvest time + structure stability

Examples:
- “Alert if carry flips negative.”
- “Warn if volatility expansion threatens theta edge.”
- “Notify when optimal decay window has passed.”
- “Suggest early exit if structure destabilizes.”

---

### 3. Batman / Tail Campaigns

**Intent**: Extreme asymmetry, rare activation

Examples:
- “Warn if entered outside chaos regime.”
- “Alert if tail probability collapses.”
- “Notify when structure begins to fracture.”
- “Highlight when optionality activates unusually early.”

---

### 4. Convexity Stack

**Intent**: Layered convex exposure across strikes

Examples:
- “Alert if stacks converge into the same risk zone.”
- “Warn if gamma exposure clusters too tightly.”
- “Notify when combined risk exceeds plan.”
- “Suggest trimming weakest convex leg.”

---

### 5. Gamma Scalping

**Intent**: Monetize movement + reversion

Examples:
- “Alert when spot oscillation supports scalping.”
- “Warn if volatility drops below scalping threshold.”
- “Notify if gamma is high but movement stalls.”
- “Suggest pause when friction dominates.”

---

## How Vexy Uses Algo Alerts

Vexy does **not** fire alerts herself —  
she **interprets them**.

### Vexy Responsibilities
- Detect alert clusters
- Translate technical triggers into narrative
- Connect alerts across time
- Surface *why* something matters

### Example Meta Commentary
> “Three alerts are converging:  
Structure is degrading, convexity has stalled,  
and time is no longer on your side.”

---

## UI / UX Implications

### Alert Cards
Algo alerts should show:
- Strategy name
- Intent summary
- Trigger condition
- Confidence / severity
- Suggested response (optional)

### Filters
- Strategy-specific
- General risk
- Profit management
- Behavioral

---

## Implementation Notes

- Algo Alerts are **data-driven**, not hardcoded
- Each alert references:
  - Strategy type
  - Evaluation function
  - Severity ladder
- Vexy consumes alert events, not raw metrics
- Overrides require notes and feed retrospectives

---

## Design Principle

> Alerts don’t trade.  
> Strategies don’t feel.  
> Vexy connects the two.

Algo Alerts are the bridge.

They make your strategies **express themselves**  
without removing human judgment.

---

## Next Possible Extensions

- Strategy-specific alert bundles (presets)
- Auto-suggested alerts when a strategy is used
- Retrospective analysis: “Which alerts mattered most?”
- Time-of-day optimization learning

---

This framing makes the alert system **strategic**, **coachable**, and **deeply Fly on the Wall**.

If you want next, I can:
- Formalize an **Algo Alert schema**
- Design **preset packs per strategy**
- Write **Vexy narration scripts** for each strategy
- Map alerts directly to **playbook rules**

Just tell me where to go next.

# Fly on the Wall (FOTW) — Journal Specification

## 1. Purpose & Role

**Role:**  
The Journal is the reflection and memory layer of Fly on the Wall.

It exists to capture:
- context
- reasoning
- emotion
- uncertainty
- restraint
- insight over time

The Journal does **not**:
- judge performance
- evaluate decisions
- optimize behavior
- score discipline
- generate conclusions

The Journal is a mirror, not a coach.

---

## 2. Core Principles

- **Calendar-first:** Time is the primary organizing axis
- **One editor:** Reflection is continuous, not modal
- **Optional structure:** Templates invite, never enforce
- **Sovereignty:** Nothing is required, scored, or blocked
- **Honesty over completeness:** Partial reflection is valid
- **Process over outcome:** Behavior and context matter more than P&L

---

## 3. Journal Orientation (Calendar-Centric)

The Journal is fundamentally **time-based**, not trade-based.

### Supported Views
- Daily view
- Weekly view
- Monthly view

Calendar gaps are visible.  
Absence is legible.  
No warnings or failure states exist.

---

## 4. Journal Entries (First-Class Objects)

Each Journal Entry:
- is anchored to a specific time scope:
  - Daily
  - Weekly
  - Monthly
- exists independently of trades
- may reference zero, one, or many trades or strategies
- is complete by virtue of reflection alone

There are no required fields.

---

## 5. Unified Journal Editor

There is **one Journal editor** for all entry types.

The same editor is used for:
- daily notes
- trade reflections
- weekly retrospectives
- monthly retrospectives

The editor supports:
- rich text / markdown
- headings, lists, emphasis
- freeform writing
- attachments

The editor never changes behavior based on entry type.

---

## 6. Time Anchoring Visuals

Each entry includes **passive time anchoring** to orient reflection.

### Primary Anchor: Time Header
Displayed above editable content:

- Daily:  
  `Tuesday · Jan 21, 2026`
- Weekly:  
  `Week of Jan 19–23, 2026`
- Monthly:  
  `January 2026`

Characteristics:
- system-generated
- non-editable
- visually subtle
- informational only

---

### Secondary Anchor: Entry Scope Indicator (Optional)

A light metadata label near the header:
- `Daily`
- `Weekly Retrospective`
- `Monthly Retrospective`

Not interactive.  
Not emphasized.

---

## 7. Retrospectives (Weekly & Monthly)

Retrospectives are **journal entries with a wider time lens**, not a separate activity.

### Weekly Retrospectives
- Anchored to a calendar week
- Focus on patterns, behavior, and process
- May reference multiple daily entries, trades, or strategies

### Monthly Retrospectives
- Anchored to a calendar month
- Focus on regime, drawdown tolerance, campaign effectiveness, philosophy alignment
- Primary input into Playbook development

No separate editor.  
No special mode.

---

## 8. Retrospective Panel (Navigation Only)

The Retrospective Panel acts as a **navigator**, not a workspace.

It may:
- show recent weekly/monthly retrospectives
- provide quick access to past entries
- initiate new weekly or monthly entries

It does **not**:
- host an editor
- enforce cadence
- manage content

---

## 9. Templates (Optional, Disposable Scaffolding)

### Template Behavior
- Templates are stored prompts
- Selecting a template **pastes text into the editor**
- Inserted text is fully editable
- Templates disappear into the document after insertion

Templates are not forms.

---

### Template Rules
- Blank entry is always the default
- Templates are optional
- Sections may be deleted or ignored
- Multiple templates may be inserted into one entry
- No completion tracking
- No validation

---

### Core Templates (Suggested)
- End-of-Day Reflection
- Trade Reflection
- Weekly Retrospective
- Monthly Retrospective

---

## 10. Trade Log Integration (Referential)

Journal entries may reference:
- one or more trades from the Trade Log
- zero trades at all

References are:
- links, not embeds
- non-transactional
- non-analytic

Trades do not require journal entries.  
Journal entries do not require trades.

---

## 11. Analyzer Integration (Idea-Level Reflection)

From a Journal Entry, a trader may:
- send a referenced trade back to the Analyzer
- create a new Strategy Instance in the Analyzer
- associate strategies with the entry for analysis context

This allows learning from:
- executed trades
- adjusted trades
- examined but untraded ideas

---

## 12. Attachments & Media

Journal Entries support:
- images (charts, screenshots)
- documents (PDFs, notes)
- reference files

Attachments are:
- time-anchored
- preserved as snapshots
- never updated automatically

What was seen at the time is what is remembered.

---

## 13. Review Mode

In review mode:
- Entries are shown chronologically
- Time headers remain visible
- Weekly/monthly entries are visually distinct by scope only
- No P&L, stats, or metrics are shown

The goal is **pattern recognition**, not evaluation.

---

## 14. Alerts & Reminders (Supportive Only)

Optional alerts may exist for:
- end-of-day reflection
- weekly retrospectives
- monthly retrospectives

### Alert Principles
- time-based, not behavior-based
- dismissible
- non-escalating
- phrased as invitations

Examples:
- “You may want to capture today.”
- “Your weekly review is available.”
- “A monthly reflection window is open.”

No streaks.  
No penalties.  
No shame.

---

## 15. Playbook Integration (One-Way Flow)

- Playbooks may be distilled from Journal material
- Journal entries may be flagged as “Potential Playbook Material”
- Playbooks reference journal lineage

Journal entries never reference Playbooks.

Directionality is preserved:

> Experience → Reflection → Distillation

---

## 16. Explicit Non-Goals

The Journal must never include:
- emotion scoring
- habit tracking
- streaks or completion rates
- AI-generated insights
- performance grading
- forced prompts
- blocking actions

Reflection remains human-owned.

---

## 17. Sovereignty & Persistence

- Journal content is owned by the trader
- Entries are never modified automatically
- The system never rewrites past reflection
- No reinterpretation is applied later

Memory is preserved, not revised.

---

## One-Sentence Essence

**The FOTW Journal is a calendar-based, unified reflection system — supporting daily notes, weekly and monthly retrospectives, and deep learning — without ever turning reflection into a task, a score, or a performance.**

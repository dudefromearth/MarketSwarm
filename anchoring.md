# FOTW Journal — Time Anchoring Visuals Specification

## Purpose

Time anchoring visuals exist to **orient reflection in time** without imposing structure, ceremony, or obligation.

They answer one question clearly and immediately:

> *“What span of time does this journal entry represent?”*

Anchoring visuals support awareness and routine through clarity — not enforcement.

---

## Core Principle

**Time is the organizing spine of reflection.**

Anchoring visuals must:
- be passive
- be non-intrusive
- require no interaction
- preserve freeform expression

They provide context, not instruction.

---

## Anchoring Scope Types

Each Journal Entry is anchored to exactly one of the following scopes:

- **Daily**
- **Weekly**
- **Monthly**

Scope is determined at entry creation and does not alter editor behavior.

---

## 1. Primary Anchor: Time Header

Each Journal Entry displays a subtle, system-generated time header at the top of the document.

### Header Formats

- **Daily Entry**  
  `Tuesday · Jan 21, 2026`

- **Weekly Retrospective**  
  `Week of Jan 19–23, 2026`

- **Monthly Retrospective**  
  `January 2026`

### Characteristics

- Displayed above the editable content
- Not user-editable
- Not required to be acknowledged
- Visually lighter than user-entered text

The header orients without interrupting thought.

---

## 2. Secondary Anchor: Entry Type Indicator

A small, non-dominant indicator may be displayed near the time header:

- `Daily`
- `Weekly Retrospective`
- `Monthly Retrospective`

### Constraints

- Not clickable
- Not interactive
- Not emphasized
- Serves as metadata only

The indicator exists for clarity, not instruction.

---

## 3. Calendar View Reinforcement

In calendar-based views:

- **Daily entries** highlight a single date
- **Weekly retrospectives** subtly span the entire week
- **Monthly retrospectives** subtly span the entire month

### Visual Guidelines

- Low-contrast highlighting
- No badges or alerts
- No “completion” signals

Absence remains visible. Presence is legible.

---

## 4. Editor Behavior (Invariant)

Time anchoring must **not**:

- change editor layout
- change formatting rules
- enforce templates
- require special actions
- restrict content

The same Journal editor is used for all scopes.

---

## 5. Template Interaction (Optional, Non-Binding)

When a template is used:
- It may be contextually appropriate to the scope
- It is pasted as editable text
- It may be edited or deleted immediately

Templates do not define scope.  
Scope defines only time context.

---

## 6. Review Mode Behavior

In review mode:
- Entries are displayed chronologically
- Time headers remain visible
- Weekly and monthly entries are visually distinct only by header content

No metrics or performance data are displayed alongside journal entries.

---

## 7. Non-Goals (Explicit)

Anchoring visuals must never:
- create pressure to write
- enforce cadence
- block entry creation
- highlight “missed” periods
- escalate alerts

Time anchoring exists to clarify, not to judge.

---

## One-Sentence Essence

**Time anchoring visuals quietly situate reflection in time — allowing daily notes, weekly retrospectives, and monthly retrospectives to coexist naturally in a single journal without changing how traders write or think.**
